When generating game logic, especially state transitions, player decisions, or scoring calculations, include informative logging statements using Python's standard `logging` module. Get the logger via `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Log key events like action taken, resources gained/lost, state changes, errors encountered. Use appropriate levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING).
